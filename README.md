# quantum-field-theory-notes
These are my notes from learning quantum field theory using the book "Quantum Field Theoru for the Gifted Amateur" by Tom Lancaster & Stephen J. Blundell. This is mostly just so that my notes are all in one spot, but I made it public because it may help someone down the road.
